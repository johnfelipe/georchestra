Version 18.06
=============

Release crafted for the [GeoGrandEst](https://twitter.com/geograndest) project, with contributions from other SDIs and individuals (mostly @landryb and @jusabatier).
Thank you all for your continuous support !

Major highlights:

 less relevant since we integrated GeoNetwork 3.

This release received important contributions from the community.
The major one being that the project delivers generic artifacts (WARs, Debian & RPM packages, Docker images), which allow for a wider distribution by removing the need for compilation.
A strong focus was also laid on infrastructure, with the integration of the [docker image generation process](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/1178) in the main repository and also with the [automation of the install process allowed by ansible](https://github.com/georchestra/ansible).

Full list of issues on GitHub issue tracker, tagged with milestone [15.06](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues?q=milestone%3A15.06).

Please note that:
 * the protocol between the security proxy and the apps was slightly modified as a result of [#920](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/920). This means that the proxy and webapps from this release are not backward-compatible: you cannot use mapfishapp from 15.06 with a 14.12 security-proxy.
 * geOrchestra 14.01 is not supported anymore.

Many thanks to all contributors for this great release !
